A personal loan is an installment loan that you can use to fund any purpose. Personal loans generally come with better loan terms and interest rates than car title loans. Depending on your needs and the amount required, you can get one for a very short term, ranging from six to 18 months or longer.

To qualify for a loan and to get the best rates and repayment terms, you must meet a lender's borrowing criteria. These typically include a steady income stream and a low debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.2 Lenders also look for a good credit score with a decent payment history.

Some lenders, such as online lenders, can approve and fund your loan as soon as the same day of your application.
